# Embedding Guided End-to-End Framework for Robust Image Watermarking
## Overview
In this paper, an end-to-end framework based on embedding guidance is proposed for robust image watermarking. It contains four modules, i.e., prior knowledge extractor, encoder, attacking simulator, and decoder. To guide the watermark embedding, the prior knowledge extractor providing chrominance and edge information of cover images is used to modify cover images before inserting the watermark by the encoder. To enhance the robustness of watermark extraction, the attacking simulator applying various differentiable attacks on the encoded images is introduced before extracting the watermark by the decoder. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves a good balance between invisibility and robustness and is superior to state-of-the-art algorithms.
